I am a developer who loves building deep learning models, solving problems, writing tutorials and clean code. Currently I'm exploring quantum computing and competitive programming via C++.

I am a CSE Undergraduate at [Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology](https://kiit.ac.in/) and a core member of [Developer Students Club, KIIT](https://dsckiit.tech/) where I organize weekly sessions and workshops for college students and publish articles on their [Medium](https://iiverveii.medium.com/) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/iiverveii).

I am one of 120 scholars across India to be selected for the [Women Technical Engineering Fellows Program](https://wtef.talentsprint.com/) by Google and Talentsprint. I am also one of the 8000 students globally who are part of the IBM's [QuibitxQuibit](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/) program taught by MIT researchers.
